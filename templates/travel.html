        <p class="lead">Croydon is not served by the Underground network. However the old East London Line has been
            integrated into the new
            London Overground network, linking West Croydon Station to Dalston Junction via New Cross, Docklands, and
            Whitechapel.
            This service, which started in June 2010, uses new rolling stock with longitudinal seating layouts similar
            to
            those used
            on Underground trains allowing for more standing room. It is operated by Transport for London as part of the
            London
            Overground scheme.</p>

        <p class="lead">A tramlink tram bound for Croydon
            Tramlink, opened in 2000, is the first modern tram system to operate in Greater London. Trams at the moment
            have
            destinations at Beckenham, Wimbledon, Elmers End and New Addington with all lines traveling through Croydon,
            on
            the
            Croydon Loop. It can also be used to reach the Underground in Wimbledon. Tramlink also has planned
            extensions to
            the M25
            motorway (Park & Ride system), Sutton, Bromley, Lewisham with a planned extension to Crystal Palace. All
            these
            plans

            airport.

            James—is
            an
            interchange station for train, tram and bus. Trains run into the centre of London terminating at Victoria or
            London
            Bridge stations in about 20-40 minutes. Services leaving London generally terminate at Sutton but some
            continue
            to
            Guildford, Dorking and Epsom Downs.</p>
